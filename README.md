React Native App.

Step 1 "Screen layout. Working with styles. Debug"

- Set up a development environment to work with React Native.
- Create basic screens and components for your app.
- Style your components.
- Run and test your app on physical devices and emulators.
- Use tools to debug and fix bugs in your app.

Step 2 "Event handling. Working with text inputs and the keyboard"

- Add and handle form logic in your application.
- Collect data from forms and output it to the console.
- Manage the keyboard, including auto-closing when clicking outside the form.
- Increase the interactivity and user experience of your application.

Step 3 "Navigation"

- Create screens and customize navigation between them.
  >> npm install @react-navigation/native
  >> npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
- Use createStackNavigator to implement stack navigation.
  >> npm install @react-navigation/stack
  >> npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler
  >> And also add an import of this library to the topmost file in the project hierarchy - App.js.
  >> import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
- Customize transitions between screens.
- Add bottom navigation using createBottomTabNavigator.
  >> npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
- Style navigation to improve user experience.

Step 4 "Native components"

- Integrate native components such as a camera into your application.
  >> npx expo install expo-camera
  >> npx expo install expo-media-library
- Process images taken with the camera.
- Add and store text information along with photos.
- Use geolocation to determine location.
  >> npx expo install react-native-maps
  >> npx expo install expo-location
- Customize screen transitions based on functionality related to photos and geolocation.

Step 5 "Redux and Firebase"

- Integrate Redux into your project to manage the state of application.
  >> npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux redux-persist
  >> In mobile development, there is no usual localStorage. Instead, you need to install an additional library
  >> npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
  >> npx expo install firebase
  >> npx expo customize metro.config.js
- Connect Firebase for user authentication and data storage.
- Implement registration and login functionality via Firebase.
- Update user profile in Firebase and store user data in Redux.
- Add authorization verification logic and redirect to appropriate screens.
- Implement login functionality, post upload, and commenting using Firebase and Redux.

Step 6 "Deployment on the expo server"

- Prepare your project for deployment.
- Use Expo tools to publish your application.
- Upload your project to Expo servers for further testing and access.
